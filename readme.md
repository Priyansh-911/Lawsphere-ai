This is an AI based Legal case management system where we harnes the power of AI to allocate judges to the cases based on multiple features of the case from the available bench based on historical data to make efficient use of the courts resources and solve the cases in no time.

we take inspiration from the Bug triaging system on which far more research and implementation has been done so as to allocate the bugs to the developer in accordance with the history of the developer.
In many of such systems they try to solve it using multiple approaches such as use of DRNN-A, by assuming it to be a classification problem and applying ML models. We take a different route to address the problem by using LLMs.
