Expected System Behavior
This detailed case description is designed to rigorously test the Lawsphere system:

Extracted Attributes:
Case Type: Criminal
Case Subtype: Financial Fraud
Party Count: 5
Seriousness: HIGH (due to the scale of fraud, number of victims, and financial impact)
Legal Sections: ["Section 420 IPC", "Section 406 IPC", "Section 120B IPC", "Section 467 IPC", "Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988"]
Complexity: HIGH (involves multiple parties, international transactions, and forensic evidence)
Judge Allocation:
Based on the sample judge dataset (Page 44), the system should recommend Justice C. Mehta (specialization: Criminal, past cases: Murder, Assault, Narcotics Offenses, Environmental Crimes, 15 pending cases). Reasoning: Justice Mehta’s specialization in criminal law aligns with the case type, despite a higher pending case count compared to others like Justice E. Reddy (Tax Law) or Justice F. Verma (Environmental Law), who are not suitable for this criminal case.
Integration Testing Scenarios:
User Application: Test the submission process by uploading the PDF and ensuring the system extracts the correct fields (case type, subtype, seriousness, legal sections, party count).
AI Processing: Verify that the Gemini LLM correctly identifies the attributes and generates a JSON output like:

json
{
  "case_type": "Criminal",
  "case_subtype": "Financial Fraud",
  "party_count": 5,
  "legal_sections": ["Section 420 IPC", "Section 406 IPC", "Section 120B IPC", "Section 467 IPC", "Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988"]
}

Admin Application: Confirm that the admin can review the AI recommendation, see the suggested judge (Justice C. Mehta), and approve or override the allocation.
Data Pipeline: Ensure the LegalCaseImputer class processes the detailed text, handles attachments (e.g., FIR, bank statements), and manages any errors (e.g., missing fields).
Database Storage: Check that the PostgreSQL database stores the case data, AI output, and attachments correctly for audit trails.
Scalability Test: The lengthy description (3-4 pages) tests the system’s ability to handle large inputs without performance degradation (e.g., API response time <300 ms, inference time ~1.2 seconds).
